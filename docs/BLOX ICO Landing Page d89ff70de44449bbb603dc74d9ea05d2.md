## Workflow for Splitting and Merging Development

To ensure efficient and effective development of the ICO Landing Page, the workflow will be divided into four main areas: Database (DB), API, Widgets, and Merging Development. Each area will be assigned to one developer. GitHub will be used for version control, with clear and concise comments for each commit. Regular commits should be made after completing each task, and a specific team member will be responsible for merging all changes.

1. **Initial Setup** (Day 1):
   - Set up repositories and initial project structure.
   - Database developer starts working on the schema.
   - API and frontend developers start setting up their environments.
2. **Parallel Development** (Day 2-3):
   - DB developer completes the schema and starts testing.
   - API developer implements endpoints and writes unit tests.
   - Frontend developer builds the components and integrates WalletConnect.
3. **Integration Phase** (Day 4):
   - Full stack developer begins integrating frontend and backend.
   - Conduct integration testing and resolve any issues.
   - Prepare for deployment and write end-to-end tests.
4. **Final Testing and Deployment** (Day 5):
   - Complete integration and end-to-end testing.
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
   - Deploy the application to the staging environment for final validation.
