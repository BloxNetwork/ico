### Initial API Connection

Upon loading the page, the backend makes initial API requests to fetch mandatory properties required for the form. During this process, the form displays a "Loading" status to indicate that data is being retrieved.

### Form Status

- **Loading**: Displayed while API requests are being made.
- **Ready**: Displayed once all values are fetched successfully.
- **Error Handling**: If the request fails, the loader remains indefinitely (until the page reloads).

### API Loading Workflow

The workflow starts by fetching presale details from the `/api/presale` endpoint, which provides information on the presale's status, funds raised, goal, and token pricing. Next, the backend requests a list of available payment methods from `/api/payment/methods`, detailing the tokens and their supported blockchain networks. When a user selects a token and network, the backend retrieves conversion rates from `/api/payment/method/{chain_id}/{symbol}` to calculate the value of tokens in USD and enable the purchase. This process ensures that users receive up-to-date presale information and accurate conversion rates for a smooth transaction experience.

## User Flow

1. **Connect Wallet**:
   - If the wallet is not connected, the user clicks the "Connect Wallet" button.
   - The WalletConnect modal opens, allowing the user to connect their wallet by scanning a QR code with their mobile wallet app.
   - Upon successful connection, the user's address and balance are retrieved and displayed.
2. **Select Payment Method**:
   - The user selects the desired payment method, including the token and chain (e.g., USDT on Ethereum, BNB on BSC Chain). After that the backend retrieves conversion rates from `/api/payment/method/{chain_id}/{symbol}` to calculate the value of tokens in USD and enable the purchase.
3. **Input Value in Tokens or USD**:
   - The user inputs the amount they wish to invest in either tokens or USD.
   - The form calculates and displays the corresponding number of tokens they will receive based on the current price.
4. **Click Buy and Proceed with Transaction**:
   - The user clicks the "Buy" button to initiate the transaction.
   - A confirmation modal appears, showing the transaction details and prompting the user to confirm.
   - Once confirmed, the transaction is submitted to the blockchain.
5. **Update Balance Locally**:
   - To provide a better user experience, the balance is updated locally immediately after the transaction is made, without waiting for blockchain confirmations.
6. **On-chain Transaction Listener**:
   - The backend service listens for the on-chain transaction using a callback mechanism.
   - Once the transaction is detected, the database is updated with the transaction details, including token amount, chain, current token price, and received token amount.
